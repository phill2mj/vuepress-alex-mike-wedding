# Frequently Asked Questions

---
- #### What should I wear to the ceremony?
Whatever you feel best in! The groom will be in a suit as will some family members. If you'd rather dress down to a nice shirt and jeans, or a casual dress that's also fine! See below for weather.

- #### What should I wear outside of the ceremony?
The Mountain is at roughly 4000ft above sea level! Last year around this time, the highs were in the upper 70s and the lows were in the low 60s. Bring lighter clothes for the day, but expect cooler temperatures in the evening.
A sweater, long pants for the evening, and a rain jacket (just in case!) wouldn't be a bad idea.

- #### What else should I pack?
If you can, bring your reusable water bottle and/or travel mug. This will help the Mountain cut down on dishes.

It gets dark on the Mountain at night, so a flashlight or headlamp could be helpful; or just use your phone.

We'll provide beer, wine, and some non-alcoholic selections for Saturday, but feel free to bring your flask, sodas, or anything else you
might want to drink over the weekend. If you have a favorite board game, we'll be socializing and playing games friday night after dinner!

The Mountain will serve dinner on Friday, Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner/Cake on Saturday, and Breakfast on Sunday, and snacks will be provided at cocktail hour. If you want your own stash of snacks feel free to bring them as well.
